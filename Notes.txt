🚀 Key Differences:
Aspect	Mediator	Observer
Communication	Centralized via mediator	Decentralized via direct notifications
Dependencies	Objects depend on mediator	Observers depend on subject
Control Flow	Mediator controls interactions	Subject notifies; observers react
Use Case	Complex workflows, UI coordination	Event handling, reactive systems
Example	Air Traffic Control	News Subscription, GUI event system
In simple terms:

Mediator = “Talk to the mediator, and they’ll handle the rest.”
Observer = “If something changes, I’ll let you know directly.”
